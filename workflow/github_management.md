# Github management

We decided to use github to manage our project.

What we did to progress the project:
- Make issues
- people create branches and carry out issues
- merge branches back

## Branches:

We decided to follow this resource for our branch conventions

    - [Branch convensions](https://gist.github.com/revett/88ee5abf5a9a097b4c88 "Branch conventions)
    - We found that this was a clear and easy way to name our branches.
